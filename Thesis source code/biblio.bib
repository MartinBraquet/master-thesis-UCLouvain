abstract = {SUMMARY Wireless sensor nodes (WSNs) are expected to play an increasing role in multiple application areas. These application areas vary from networks around the human body, sensors in smart tires, sensor networks that can control the safety and comfort levels throughout smart buildings, sensors that monitor the necessity for maintenance and sensors that track the conditions of food throughout the distribution chain. These wireless sensors need energy, which can be supplied by a battery or an energy harvester. However, even when an energy harvester is applied, energy storage is required to serve as energy buffer. In this review, the requirements that different types of wireless sensor networks impose on these batteries are explored, and several suitable types of batteries are reviewed. Moreover, the trends in battery development are described, and the future improvements are predicted. Finally, the possibilities are discussed to select a battery with properties that are matched to the requirements of the sensor nodes. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={The discovery and development of electrode materials promise superior energy or power density. However, good performance is typically achieved only in ultrathin electrodes with low mass loadings (<=1 mg cm-2) and is difficult to realize in commercial electrodes with higher mass loadings (>10 mg cm-2). To realize the full potential of these electrode materials, new electrode architectures are required that can allow more efficient charge transport beyond the limits of traditional electrodes. In this Review, we summarize the design and synthesis of 3D electrodes to address charge transport limitations in thick electrodes. Specifically, we discuss the role of charge transport in electrochemical systems and focus on the design of 3D porous structures with a continuous conductive network for electron transport and a fully interconnected hierarchical porosity for ion transport. We also discuss the application of 3D porous architectures as conductive scaffolds for various electrode materials to enable composite electrodes with an unprecedented combination of energy and power densities and then conclude with a perspective on future opportunities and challenges.},

abstract = "Wireless power transfer (WPT) has emerged as a solution for supplying smart sensors for long-term battery-less deployment. Because the amount of power harvested by the smart sensor is limited due to WPT path loss, the optimization objective is twofold: achieving ultra-low-power operation for the sensing task and improving the harvesting efficiency even at low incident power. In this paper, we focus on the use case of a Bluetooth LE-connected motion detection system supplied by 2.45-GHz RF power. The full system (RF energy harvester, power management, sensor transducer and interface, control, data processing and wireless transmission) is implemented using low-power off-the-shelf components. In the sensing sub-system, ultra-low-power operation is achieved by the duty-cycling of the sensor interface and by an event-driven scheme for communication. In the harvesting sub-system, the design of the matching network and rectifier, combined with maximum power point tracking (MPPT), is optimized for increasing the power harvesting efficiency (PHE) at low incident power. Measurements show a total reduction in the power consumption for the sensing sub-system by a factor 20. When using custom WPT waveform with high peak-to-average power ratio, the RF energy harvester is functional with an incident RF power starting from −20 dBm. The smart sensor is able to perform its motion-detection task with an incident power as low as −17.3 dBm."
