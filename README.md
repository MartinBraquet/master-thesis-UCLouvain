# Master's thesis at UCLouvain

This is the source code of my Master's thesis at UCLouvain (June 2020).

It includes all the simulations required for this work:
* **Audio processing**: C code for the microcontroller and Matlab code to process the data (plot the graphs) received from the board
* **BOM**: Excel file with the bill of materials
* **IV mic**: Matlab code to plot the IV curves (current/voltage) of different microphones
* **Microcontroller**: Wisebatt simulation to provide a rough estimate of the whole system power consumption
* **Microphone**: LTspice and Matlab codes for the microphone/AFE subsystem (AC and noise)
* **PCB**: KiCad and Eagle files for the PCB design (schematic and PCB layout)
* **Power management**: Matlab and Excel files for measurements about the supercapacitor, solar cells, PMU and luminosity
* **Thesis source code**: LaTeX source code of the Master's thesis
